<h2>Tips for Using These Templates</h2>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>1. <strong>Start with self-review templates</strong> - Build the habit of reviewing your own code first</p>
<p>2. <strong>Customize for your team</strong> - Adapt the language and format to match your team's culture</p>
<p>3. <strong>Begin with shorter templates</strong> - Use the quick review request template before moving to more comprehensive ones</p>
<h3>Best Practices</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be specific</strong> - Generic requests get generic feedback</li>
<li><strong>Show appreciation</strong> - Always thank reviewers for their time and insights</li>
<li><strong>Ask questions</strong> - It's better to ask for clarification than to guess</li>
<li><strong>Track your progress</strong> - Use the learning log to see your improvement over time</li>
</ul>
<h3>Building Relationships</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be patient with reviewers</strong> - They're taking time to help you improve</li>
<li><strong>Offer to review others' code</strong> - Reviewing code is a great way to learn</li>
<li><strong>Share what you learn</strong> - Help other junior developers with insights from your reviews</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember: Code reviews are learning opportunities, not judgment sessions. These templates will help you approach them with confidence and professionalism while building valuable skills and relationships with your development team.</p></div>
