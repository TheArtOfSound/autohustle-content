<p>#### Prompt 12: The Unfinished Symphony</p>
<p>Write about your most important unfinished project. What would it look like completed? What's really stopping you from finishing it? What would happen if you let it stay unfinished?</p>
<p>#### Prompt 13: The Content Creator's Confession</p>
<p>Write a brutally honest piece about the gap between your online persona and your real life. What do you hide? What do you amplify? What would change if you closed this gap?</p>
<p>#### Prompt 14: The Viral Moment Autopsy</p>

<h3>Category 4: Digital Relationships & Community</h3>

<p>#### Prompt 17: The Online-Offline Bridge</p>
<p>Describe meeting an online connection in person for the first time. What was different? What was the same? How did the digital relationship translate to physical space?</p>
<p>#### Prompt 18: The Community You Built</p>
<p>Write about a community, group, or audience you've cultivated. What drew people together? What keeps them engaged? What responsibility do you feel toward them?</p>

<h3>Category 5: Future Vision & Adaptation</h3>

<h3>Category 6: Personal Philosophy & Values</h3>
