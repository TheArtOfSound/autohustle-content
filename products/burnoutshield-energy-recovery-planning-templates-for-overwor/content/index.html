<p>---</p>
<p>#### Setting Initial Expectations</p>
<p><strong>New Client Onboarding Script:</strong></p>
<p>"I'm excited to work with you on [PROJECT]. To ensure we have a successful partnership, I'd like to share my working style and availability. I typically work [DAYS] from [TIME] to [TIME], and my standard email response time is [TIMEFRAME]. For project changes or additional requests, I use a change order process to keep everything clear and documented. Does this approach work well for your needs?"</p>
<p><strong>Project Scope Discussion:</strong></p>
<p>"Based on our conversation, I understand you need [SUMMARIZE PROJECT]. This includes [LIST DELIVERABLES]. The timeline is [DURATION] and the investment is [AMOUNT]. If additional work is needed beyond this scope, I'll provide an estimate for your approval before proceeding. Sound good?"</p>
<p>#### Responding to Boundary Challenges</p>
<p><strong>After-Hours Contact:</strong></p>
<p>"Thanks for reaching out. I received your message outside my normal business hours ([TIME] - [TIME], [DAYS]). I'll review this and respond by [SPECIFIC TIME] during my next business day. If this is truly urgent and can't wait, please [EMERGENCY CONTACT PROTOCOL]."</p>
<p><strong>Scope Creep Response:</strong></p>
<p>"I love that you're thinking of additional ways to enhance the project! The work you're describing falls outside our original agreement for [ORIGINAL SCOPE]. I'd be happy to provide a quote for this additional work. Would you like me to send over an estimate?"</p>
<p><strong>Rush Request Response:</strong></p>
<p>"I understand this has become a priority for you. My current schedule allows me to complete this by [REALISTIC DATE]. If you need it by [THEIR REQUESTED DATE], I can accommodate that with a rush fee of [PERCENTAGE]% and will need to adjust other project timelines. Which option works better for you?"</p>
<p><strong>Payment Reminder Scripts:</strong></p>
<p><strong>First Reminder (Friendly):</strong></p>
<p>"Hi [CLIENT NAME], I hope you're doing well! I wanted to follow up on invoice #[NUMBER] for [PROJECT], which was due on [DATE]. Could you please let me know the status of this payment? Thanks so much!"</p>
<p><strong>Second Reminder (Firm but Professional):</strong></p>
<p>"Hi [CLIENT NAME], I'm following up again on invoice #[NUMBER] for [AMOUNT], which is now [NUMBER] days past due. Please let me know when I can expect payment, as this affects my ability to continue work on current projects. I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter."</p>
<p><strong>Final Reminder (Clear Consequences):</strong></p>
<p>"[CLIENT NAME], invoice #[NUMBER] for [AMOUNT] is now significantly overdue. As outlined in our contract, I'll need to pause all current</p></div>
