<p>DOPAMINE PRIORITY MATRIX - Date: [DATE]</p>
<p>HIGH IMPORTANCE + HIGH DOPAMINE          | HIGH IMPORTANCE + LOW DOPAMINE</p>

<p>|</p>
<p>[List tasks that are both important     | [List important tasks that feel boring</p>
<p>and energizing/rewarding to you]        | or overwhelming - these need extra support]</p>

<p>LOW IMPORTANCE + HIGH DOPAMINE          | LOW IMPORTANCE + LOW DOPAMINE</p>
<p>(Reward Tasks - Use Strategically!)     | (Eliminate or Delegate!)</p>
<p>|</p>
<p>[List enjoyable tasks that aren't       | [List tasks that drain energy and</p>

<p>TODAY'S FOCUS:</p>
<p>1. Start with: [Pick 1-2 items from HIGH/HIGH quadrant]</p>
