<p>First, I want to say <strong>I'm sorry</strong> if [PRODUCT_NAME] hasn't lived up to your expectations. That's on us, not you.</p>
<p><strong>Before you cancel, can I ask for 2 minutes of your time?</strong></p>
<p>I've helped [NUMBER] customers who were in your exact situation turn things around and achieve [POSITIVE_OUTCOME]. Most of the time, it comes down to one of these fixable issues:</p>
<p>❌ <strong>"It's too complicated"</strong> → I can simplify your setup in 10 minutes</p>
<p>❌ <strong>"I'm not seeing results"</strong> → Let me show you the [SUCCESS_METRIC] strategy that [CUSTOMER_EXAMPLE] used</p>

<p>❌ <strong>"I don't have time to use it"</strong> → I can set up [AUTOMATION_FEATURE] to save you [TIME_AMOUNT] weekly</p>
<p>❌ <strong>"It doesn't fit my needs"</strong> → Let me show you [ALTERNATIVE_USE_CASE] that might be perfect</p>
<p><strong>Here's what I'm offering:</strong></p>

<p><strong>[CTA_BUTTON: Book My Free Strategy Session]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Or, if you prefer email:</strong> Just reply and tell me what's not working. I'll send you a custom solution within 24 hours.</p>
<p>I believe we can turn this around. Will you give me the chance to prove it?</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>[YOUR_NAME]</p>
<p>[YOUR_TITLE]</p>
<p>[DIRECT_PHONE_NUMBER]</p>

<p><strong>Email Content:</strong></p>
<p>Hi [CUSTOMER_NAME],</p>
<p>I understand you've decided to cancel your [PRODUCT_NAME] subscription, and I respect that decision.</p>
<p>Before your cancellation is processed, I have one final request and one final offer.</p>
<p><strong>My personal request:</strong></p>
<p>Could you help me understand what went wrong? Your feedback will help us prevent other customers from having the same experience. It would mean a lot to me personally.</p>
<p><strong>[QUICK_FEEDBACK_LINK: Share Your Feedback (2 minutes)]</strong></p>
<p><strong>My final offer:</strong></p>
<p>I've been authorized to offer you something I've never offered before:</p>

<p>🎁 <strong>[ADDITIONAL_BONUS]</strong></p>
<p>🎁 <strong>Personal monthly check-ins</strong> with me for the next [TIME_PERIOD]</p>
<p>🎁 <strong>[CUSTOM_SOLUTION]</strong> built specifically for your needs</p>
<p>This offer is good for the next [TIME_LIMIT] only, and I can only make it to [LIMITED_NUMBER] customers per month.</p>
<p><strong>Why am I doing this?</strong> Because I believe [PRODUCT_NAME] can genuinely help you achieve [THEIR_GOAL], and I don't want you to miss out on that opportunity because we didn't execute well enough the first time.</p>
<p><strong>[CTA_BUTTON: Accept This Special Offer]</strong></p>
<p>If you still decide to cancel, I completely understand. But please know that our door is always open if you want to try again in the future.</p>
<p>Thank you for giving us a chance.</p>
<p>With respect,</p>
<p>[YOUR_NAME]</p>
<p>[YOUR_TITLE]</p>
