<h2>Bonus Tips</h2>
<h3>Maximizing Your Micro-Moments</h3>
<p><strong>1. Set a Timer</strong></p>
<p>Use these prompts with a 5-10 minute timer. The constraint will push you to write instinctively rather than overthinking.</p>
<p><strong>2. Don't Edit During the Exercise</strong></p>
<p>Let your first draft be messy. These prompts are about generating raw material, not polished prose.</p>
<p><strong>3. Build on Previous Prompts</strong></p>
<p>If a character or situation intrigues you, revisit them with different prompts. You might discover your next story.</p>
<p><strong>4. Use Voice Recording</strong></p>
<p>If you're away from your keyboard, record your response to prompts on your phone. Sometimes speaking the story first unlocks different creative pathways.</p>
<p><strong>5. Create Prompt Combinations</strong></p>
<p>Mix and match elements from different prompts. What happens when the "Empathy Thief" meets the "Memory Archaeologist"?</p>
