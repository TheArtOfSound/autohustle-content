<h2>Digital Awareness & Assessment Prompts</h2>

<h3><strong>Prompt 1: Digital Dependency Audit</strong></h3>
<p>Write about your most-used digital tools and platforms. For each one, answer: What value does this add to my life and business? What problems does it create? If I had to give up one digital tool for a week, which would be hardest to lose and why? What does this tell me about my dependencies?</p>

<h3><strong>Prompt 2: The Notification Inventory</strong></h3>
<p>List every notification you received in the last hour. Categorize them as: Essential for business, Helpful but not urgent, or Pure distraction. Write about how each category makes you feel and which ones actually require immediate attention. What patterns do you notice?</p>

<h3><strong>Prompt 3: Digital Energy Drain Analysis</strong></h3>
<p>Reflect on the last time you felt energized versus drained after using technology. Describe both experiences in detail. What specific digital activities boost your energy and creativity? Which ones leave you feeling scattered or depleted? How can you design your digital day around energy-giving activities?</p>

<h3><strong>Prompt 4: The Always-On Trap</strong></h3>
<p>Explore your relationship with being constantly available. When was the last time you were completely unreachable for 4+ hours? How did that feel? What fears come up when you imagine turning off all devices for half a day? What opportunities might you be missing by always being "on"?</p>

<h3><strong>Prompt 5: Digital Multitasking Reality Check</strong></h3>
<p>Write about a recent work session where you tried to multitask with multiple digital tools. How many browser tabs did you have open? How many apps were running? How did your attention feel throughout this session? What was the quality of work produced compared to focused, single-task sessions?</p>

<h2>Boundary Setting & Protection Prompts</h2>

<h3><strong>Prompt 6: The Sacred Hours</strong></h3>
<p>Identify the 2-3 hours in your day when you do your most important work. Write about how digital distractions currently infiltrate these hours. Design a "sacred hours" protocol: What devices will be off? What apps will be blocked? How will you handle urgent requests during this time? What will you gain by protecting these hours?</p>

<h3><strong>Prompt 7: Client Communication Boundaries</strong></h3>
<p>Reflect on your current communication expectations with clients. Are you available 24/7? Do you respond to emails within minutes? Write about the diffe...</p>
