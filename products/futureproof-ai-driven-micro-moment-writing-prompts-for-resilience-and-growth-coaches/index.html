<h2>Section 1: Foundation Building - Core Resilience Assessment Prompts</h2>

<p><em>These prompts help establish baseline resilience patterns and identify core strengths and vulnerabilities.</em></p>

<h3>FB-01: Resilience Inventory Mapping</h3>
<p>```</p>
<p>Write a detailed personal resilience inventory by completing this framework: "When facing challenges, I typically..." followed by three specific examples from the past year. For each example, identify: (1) the initial emotional response, (2) the coping strategy used, (3) the outcome achieved, and (4) one insight gained. Then rate each coping strategy's effectiveness on a 1-10 scale and explain why.</p>
<p>```</p>

<h3>FB-02: Stress Response Pattern Analysis</h3>
<p>```</p>
<p>Describe your stress response patterns by analyzing three different types of stressors you've encountered: (1) acute unexpected crisis, (2) chronic ongoing pressure, and (3) anticipatory anxiety about future events. For each type, detail your physical sensations, emotional reactions, thought patterns, and behavioral responses. Identify which response pattern serves you best and which needs the most attention.</p>
<p>```</p>

<h3>FB-03: Support System Architecture</h3>
<p>```</p>
<p>Map your current support system by creating three categories: (1) emotional supporters (who you turn to for comfort), (2) practical supporters (who help with solutions), and (3) growth supporters (who challenge you to improve). List 2-3 people in each category, describe how each relationship functions, and identify any gaps in your support architecture. Then write about one action you could take to strengthen each category.</p>
<p>```</p>

<h3>FB-04: Values-Based Resilience Foundation</h3>
<p>```</p>
<p>Identify your top 5 core values and write about how each one has served as a source of strength during difficult times. Provide a specific example for each value where it guided your decisions or actions during adversity. Then analyze: Which values are you currently honoring fully? Which values need more attention? How can you better align your daily choices with these resilience-building values?</p>
<p>```</p>

<h3>FB-05: Historical Resilience Timeline</h3>
<p>```</p>
<p>Create a resilience timeline covering the past 5 years by identifying 5-7 significant challenges you've overcome. For each challenge, write about: the situation, your lowest point, the turning point moment, key resources or people who helped, and the strengths you discovered about yourself. Look for patterns across these experiences and identify your most reliable resilience strategies.</p>
<p>```</p>

<h3>FB-06: Energy Audit Assessment</h3>
<p>```</p>
<p>Conduct a comprehensive energy audit by tracking your energy levels across different life domains for one week. Write about patterns you notice in: (1) physical energy (when you feel most/least energetic), (2) emotional energy (what drains vs. fuels you emotionally), (3) mental energy (when your thinking is clearest vs. foggiest), and (4) spiritual energy (what connects you to purpose vs. leaves you feeling empty). Identify three specific energy drains you could address.</p>
<p>```</p>

<h3>FB-07: Cognitive Flexibility Evaluation</h3>
<p>```</p>
<p>Assess your cognitive flexibility by writing about how you typically respond to unexpected changes or disruptions. Describe three recent situations where plans changed suddenly, analyzing: your initial thought patterns, how quickly you adapted, what helped or hindered your flexibility, and alternative perspectives you considered. Rate your overall adaptability and identify specific areas where you'd like to become more flexible.</p>
<p>```</p>

<h3>FB-08: Emotional Regulation Inventory</h3>
<p>```</p>
<p>Evaluate your emotional regulation skills by examining your responses to different emotional triggers. Write about how you handle: (1) frustration or anger, (2) disappointment or sadness, (3) anxiety or fear, and (4) overwhelming joy or excitement. For each emotion, describe your typical regulation strategies, their effectiveness, and any patterns of emotional reactivity that concern you. Identify one regulation skill you'd most like to improve.</p>
<p>```</p>

<h2>Section 2: Growth Catalyst - Breakthrough Moment Discovery Prompts</h2>

<p><em>These prompts are designed to uncover hidden growth opportunities and catalyze transformational insights.</em></p>

<h3>GC-01: Limiting Belief Archaeology</h3>
<p>```</p>
<p>Excavate your limiting beliefs by completing this sentence in 10 different ways: "I can't achieve [specific goal] because..." Then for each completion, trace the belief's origin by asking: Where did this belief come from? What evidence supports or contradicts it? How has this belief served or limited you? What would be possible if this belief weren't true? Choose the three most impactful limiting beliefs and write a new, empowering belief to replace each one.</p>
<p>```</p>

<h3>GC-02: Edge of Comfort Zone Mapping</h3>
<p>```</p>
<p>Map the edges of your comfort zone by identifying areas where you feel: (1) completely comfortable and confident, (2) slightly stretched but manageable, (3) significantly challenged but still willing, and (4) too scared or resistant to engage. For each area, write about what specifically makes it comfortable or uncomfortable, what you might gain by expanding into the stretch zones, and what support you'd need to take one small step beyond your current edge.</p>
<p>```</p>

<h3>GC-03: Hidden Strength Revelation</h3>
<p>```</p>
<p>Uncover hidden strengths by writing about three times when others complimented or ...</p>
