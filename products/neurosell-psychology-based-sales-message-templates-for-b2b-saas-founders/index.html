<p>We just helped [similar company] reduce their [metric] by [percentage] after they faced the same issue. The root cause is usually [technical explanation].</p>

<p>When it comes to [relevant business process], what's working well for you right now? And what's not working as well as you'd like?</p>

<p>[Listen to response]</p>
