<p>Data types refer to the categories of data that can be stored in a cell. Understanding data types is essential for accurate calculations and data manipulation.</p>
<p>In Excel, there are several built-in data types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Number</strong>: used for numerical values (e.g., 123, -0.5)</li>
<li><strong>Text</strong>: used for strings or characters (e.g., "hello", "world")</li>
<li><strong>Date</strong>: used for dates and times</li>
<li><strong>Boolean</strong>: used for true/false values (e.g., TRUE, FALSE)</li>
<li><strong>Error</strong>: used to indicate errors or missing data</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Create a new spreadsheet and create three cells with the following data:</p>
<p>| Cell A | Cell B | Cell C |</p>
<p>| --- | --- | --- |</p>
<p>| 123 | hello | TRUE |</p>
<p>Which data type would each cell belong to?</p>
<h3>Lesson 1.2: Creating a Basic Spreadsheet Structure</h3>
<p>A basic spreadsheet structure consists of rows, columns, and cells. Understanding how to organize your data is crucial for efficient analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Columns</strong>: vertical elements that contain similar data (e.g., names, dates)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Headers</strong>: column labels (e.g., "Name", "Date")</li>
<li><strong>Data</strong>: the actual values in each cell</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rows</strong>: horizontal elements that contain multiple cells with similar data</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data range</strong>: a group of cells that contain similar data</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Create a new spreadsheet and organize your data into columns and rows. Label each column header (e.g., "Name", "Age", "City").</p>
<h3>Lesson 1.3: Working with Formulas and Functions</h3>
<p>Formulas and functions are used to perform calculations and manipulate data.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Formulas</strong>: use mathematical operations to calculate values</li>
<li><strong>Functions</strong>: pre-built formulas that perform specific tasks (e.g., SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example Formula:</strong> `=A1+B1`</p>
<p>This formula adds the values in cells A1 and B1. To use this formula, select cell C1 and type `=A1+B1`. Press Enter to see the result.</p>
<p><strong>Function Example:</strong> `SUM(A1:A5)`</p>
<p>This function calculates the sum of values in cells A1:A5. To use this function, select a new cell (e.g., C6) and type `=SUM(A1:A5)`. Press Enter to see the result.</p>
<p><strong>Action Items:</strong></p>

<h2>Module 4: Reporting and Visualization</h2>
<p>Transform your data analysis into compelling reports and interactive dashboards that communicate insights effectively. This module teaches you to create professional presentations of your findings that stakeholders can understand and act upon.</p>
<h3>Lesson 4.1: Creating a Basic Report in Excel</h3>
<p>A well-structured report tells a story with your data. Excel provides powerful tools to create reports that are both informative and visually appealing.</p>
<p><strong>Essential Report Components:</strong></p>
<p>Start every report with a clear title, date, and data source. Your audience needs context before diving into numbers. Follow this with an executive summary highlighting key findings in 2-3 bullet points.</p>
<p><strong>Building Your Report Structure:</strong></p>
<p>Create separate sections for different aspects of your analysis. Use Excel's built-in heading styles (Home > Styles) to maintain consistency. Insert page breaks between major sections using Page Layout > Breaks > Insert Page Break.</p>
<p><strong>Incorporating Charts and Tables:</strong></p>
<p>Place charts immediately after the data they represent. Use Insert > Charts to select appropriate visualizations—bar charts for comparisons, line charts for trends, pie charts for parts of a whole. Keep charts simple with clear titles and axis labels.</p>
<p>Format tables using Table Design options. Apply alternating row colors and bold headers for readability. Remove gridlines (View > Show > uncheck Gridlines) for a cleaner appearance.</p>
<p><strong>Professional Formatting Tips:</strong></p>
<p>Set consistent margins (Page Layout > Margins > Custom Margins). Use a maximum of two fonts throughout your report. Apply conditional formatting to highlight important values—select your data range, go to Home > Conditional Formatting > Data Bars or Color Scales.</p>
<p><strong>Action Items:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Create a sample sales report with at least three charts</li>
<li>Apply consistent formatting throughout</li>
<li>Add headers, footers, and page numbers</li>
<li>Practice printing preview to ensure professional appearance</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lesson 4.2: Building an Interactive Dashboard in Google Sheets</h3>
<p>Interactive dashboards allow users to explore data dynamically. Google Sheets offers excellent tools for creating dashboards that update automatically and respond to user input.</p>
<p><strong>Dashboard Planning:</strong></p>
<p>Before building, sketch your dashboard layout. Identify key metrics (KPIs) that need prominent display. Plan for 4-6 main visualizations maximum—too many charts create confusion.</p>
<p><strong>Creating Dynamic Elements:</strong></p>
<p>Use data validation to create dropdown menus. Select a cell, go to Data > Data Validation, choose "List of items" and enter your options. Link these dropdowns to filter your data using FILTER functions.</p>
<p>Example formula: `=FILTER(A2:D100,B2:B100=E1)` where E1 contains your dropdown selection.</p>
<p><strong>Building Interactive Charts:</strong></p>
<p>Insert charts that reference your filtered data ranges. As users change dropdown selections, charts update automatically. Use Insert > Chart, then customize in the Chart Editor panel.</p>
<p>Create summary cards using large, bold numbers. Format cells with custom number formats (Format > Number > Custom Number Format) to display values clearly—use "#,##0" for thousands or "#,##0.0,,"M"" for millions.</p>
<p><strong>Dashboard Layout Best Practices:</strong></p>
<p>Place the most important metrics in the top-left corner—this is where eyes naturally look first. Group related information together. Use white space effectively to avoid clutter.</p>
<p>Freeze the top rows containing your filters (View > Freeze > 2 rows) so they remain visible when scrolling.</p>
<p><strong>Adding Visual Appeal:</strong></p>
<p>Use consistent colors throughout your dashboard. Apply themes (Format > Theme) for professional appearance. Create visual hierarchy using different font sizes—larger for KPIs, smaller for supporting data.</p>
<p><strong>Action Items:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Design a dashboard with at least 3 interactive elements</li>
<li>Implement dropdown filters that update multiple charts</li>
<li>Test all interactive features thoroughly</li>
<li>Share dashboard with view-only permissions to practice access control</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lesson 4.3: Using Themes and Styles</h3>
<p>Professional appearance significantly impacts how your audience perceives your work. Both Excel and Google Sheets provide theme systems that ensure visual consistency.</p>
<p><strong>Excel Themes:</strong></p>
<p>Access themes via Page Layout > Themes. Each theme includes coordinated colors, fonts, and effects. Choose themes that match your organization's branding or the report's purpose—conservative themes for executive reports, modern themes for creative presentations.</p>
<p>Customize theme colors by clicking Page Layout > Colors > Customize Colors. Save custom themes for future use by clicking Themes > Save Current Theme.</p>
<p><strong>Google Sheets Themes:</strong></p>
<p>Apply themes through Format > Theme. Google Sheets themes automatically coordinate chart colors with your selected theme. Preview different options before applying to see how they affect your entire sheet.</p>
<p><strong>Style Consistency Rules:</strong></p>
<p>Establish a style guide for your reports. Use the same font family throughout (recommended: Calibri for Excel, Arial for Google Sheets). Maintain consistent spacing between elements. Apply the same color scheme across all visualizations.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Styling Techniques:</strong></p>
<p>Create custom cell styles in Excel using Home > Cell Styles > New Cell Style. Define styles for headers, data, and highlights. In Google Sheets, use Format > Alternating Colors for table formatting.</p>
<p>For charts, manually set colors that align with your theme. Right-click chart elements and choose Format to customize colors, fonts, and borders.</p>
<p><strong>Action Items:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Apply three different themes to the same dataset and compare results</li>
<li>Create a custom color palette that reflects your organization's branding</li>
<li>Develop a personal style guide with specific formatting rules</li>
<li>Practice applying consistent styling across multiple sheets in a workbook</li>
</ul>
<p>Master these visualization techniques to transform raw data into compelling stories that drive decision-making and engage your audience effectively.</p>
