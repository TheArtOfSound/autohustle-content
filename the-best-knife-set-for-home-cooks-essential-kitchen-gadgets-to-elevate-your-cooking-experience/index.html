<h2>Buying Guide</h2>

<p><strong>Steel Quality:</strong> Look for high-carbon stainless steel or premium Japanese steel for the best combination of sharpness retention and corrosion resistance. German steel tends to be more durable, while Japanese steel offers superior sharpness.</p>

<p><strong>Handle Comfort:</strong> Choose handles that feel comfortable in your hand and provide secure grip even when wet. Consider the weight distribution between blade and handle for optimal balance during use.</p>

<p><strong>Set Composition:</strong> Determine which knives you actually need—a chef's knife, paring knife, and bread knife cover most tasks. Larger sets may include specialty knives you'll rarely use.</p>

<p><strong>Maintenance Requirements:</strong> Consider whether you prefer low-maintenance knives that can go in the dishwasher or don't mind hand-washing premium blades that require more careful care.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<p><strong>How often should I sharpen my knives?</strong></p>
<p>Professional sharpening is typically needed every 6-12 months for home cooks, depending on usage frequency. Regular honing with a steel rod between sharpenings will maintain the edge.</p>

<p><strong>Are expensive knife sets worth the investment?</strong></p>
<p>High-quality knives last decades with proper care and perform significantly better than cheap alternatives. However, you don't need to spend a fortune—many excellent options exist in the $100-300 range.</p>

<p><strong>What's the difference between German and Japanese knives?</strong></p>
<p>German knives are typically heavier, more durable, and easier to maintain, while Japanese knives are sharper, lighter, and require more careful handling. Both styles have their advantages depending on your cooking style.</p>
