<h2>Buying Guide</h2>

<p><strong>Size Selection</strong>: Choose your ball size based on your height - 55cm for heights under 5'4", 65cm for 5'4" to 5'10", and 75cm for over 5'10". The correct size ensures proper posture and maximum benefit during exercises.</p>

<p><strong>Weight Capacity and Anti-Burst Technology</strong>: Look for balls rated at least 1000 pounds with anti-burst features. This technology prevents sudden deflation, which is crucial for safety during pregnancy when balance may be compromised.</p>

<p><strong>Surface Texture</strong>: A textured or ribbed surface provides better grip and stability, reducing the risk of slipping during exercises. This feature becomes increasingly important as your center of gravity changes throughout pregnancy.</p>

<p><strong>Included Accessories</strong>: Consider balls that come with pumps, exercise guides, and pregnancy-specific materials. These additions provide better value and help ensure you're using the ball safely and effectively.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<p><strong>Is it safe to use an exercise ball throughout pregnancy?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, exercise balls are generally safe throughout pregnancy when used properly and with your doctor's approval. They provide low-impact exercise options and can help with comfort and positioning.</p>

<p><strong>What size exercise ball should I choose for pregnancy?</strong></p>
<p>Ball size depends on your height: 55cm for under 5'4", 65cm for 5'4"-5'10", and 75cm for over 5'10". When sitting, your hips should be level with or slightly higher than your knees.</p>

<p><strong>Can I use my pregnancy exercise ball during labor?</strong></p>
<p>Many exercise balls designed for pregnancy can be used during labor for positioning and comfort. However, confirm with your healthcare provider and birthing facility about their policies and recommendations.</p>
