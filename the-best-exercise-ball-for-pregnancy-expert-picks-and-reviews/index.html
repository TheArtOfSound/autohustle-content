<h2>Buying Guide</h2>

<p><strong>Size Selection:</strong> Choose the right size based on your height. Women 5'4" and under should select a 55cm ball, while those 5'4" to 5'10" need a 65cm ball. Taller women should opt for a 75cm ball. When seated, your knees should be at a 90-degree angle.</p>

<p><strong>Safety Features:</strong> Look for anti-burst technology that allows slow deflation rather than sudden popping. This feature is crucial during pregnancy when balance may be compromised. Check the weight capacity to ensure it exceeds your current weight.</p>

<p><strong>Material Quality:</strong> Choose balls made from non-toxic, phthalate-free PVC. The material should be thick enough to prevent punctures and maintain shape over time. A textured or ribbed surface provides better grip during exercises.</p>

<p><strong>Included Accessories:</strong> Consider balls that come with pregnancy-specific exercise guides, pumps, and additional accessories like resistance bands. These additions provide better value and ensure you have everything needed for safe prenatal workouts.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<p><strong>Is it safe to use an exercise ball during pregnancy?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, exercise balls are generally safe during pregnancy when used properly. Always consult your healthcare provider before starting any new exercise routine, and avoid exercises that require lying on your back after the first trimester.</p>

<p><strong>What size exercise ball should I get for pregnancy?</strong></p>
<p>Size depends on your height: 55cm for women under 5'4", 65cm for heights 5'4" to 5'10", and 75cm for women over 5'10". The ball should allow your knees to be at 90 degrees when seated.</p>

<p><strong>Can I use an exercise ball during labor?</strong></p>
<p>Many women find exercise balls helpful during labor for positioning and comfort. However, discuss this with your healthcare provider and birth team beforehand to ensure it fits your birth plan.</p>
