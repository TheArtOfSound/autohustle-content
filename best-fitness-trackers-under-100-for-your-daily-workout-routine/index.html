<h2>Buying Guide: Key Criteria to Consider</h2>

<p><strong>Battery Life</strong> should be your first consideration when choosing a fitness tracker. Look for devices offering at least 5-7 days of battery life to avoid frequent charging interruptions. Longer battery life means more consistent tracking and fewer missed workouts due to dead devices.</p>

<p><strong>Health Monitoring Features</strong> vary significantly between models, so prioritize the metrics most important to your fitness goals. Essential features include heart rate monitoring, step counting, and sleep tracking, while advanced options might include SpO2 monitoring, stress tracking, and GPS connectivity.</p>

<p><strong>Water Resistance</strong> is crucial if you plan to wear your tracker while swimming, showering, or during intense sweaty workouts. Look for ratings of at least 5ATM or 50-meter water resistance for comprehensive protection.</p>

<p><strong>App Ecosystem and Compatibility</strong> can make or break your long-term satisfaction with a fitness tracker. Ensure the device works with your smartphone and offers an intuitive app with the data visualization and goal-setting features you need to stay motivated.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<p><strong>Q: Do fitness trackers under $100 provide accurate heart rate monitoring?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, most reputable fitness trackers in this price range offer reasonably accurate heart rate monitoring using optical sensors, though they may not match the precision of chest strap monitors during high-intensity activities.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Can budget fitness trackers track swimming workouts?</strong></p>
<p>A: Many fitness trackers under $100 are water-resistant and can track swimming, but check the specific water resistance rating (look for 5ATM or 50m) and swimming-specific features before purchasing.</p>

<p><strong>Q: How long do fitness trackers typically last before needing replacement?</strong></p>
<p>A: Quality fitness trackers under $100 typically last 2-3 years with regular use, though battery performance may decline over time, and software updates may eventually stop for older models.</p>
