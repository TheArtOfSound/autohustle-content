<h2>Buying Guide</h2>

<p><strong>Weight and Age Requirements</strong>: Always check the manufacturer's weight limits and age recommendations. Some carriers work from birth, while others require your baby to reach a certain weight or developmental milestone. Newborn-specific carriers typically accommodate babies from 7-8 pounds up to 25-35 pounds.</p>

<p><strong>Comfort and Support</strong>: Look for carriers with padded shoulder straps, wide waistbelts, and proper weight distribution. The carrier should support your baby's spine in a natural C-curve and keep their hips in the optimal "M" position. Consider how the carrier feels during extended wear periods.</p>

<p><strong>Ease of Use</strong>: Consider how easy the carrier is to put on and adjust, especially when you're sleep-deprived. Some wraps require practice to master, while structured carriers with buckles might be more straightforward for beginners.</p>

<p><strong>Fabric and Breathability</strong>: Choose breathable fabrics appropriate for your climate. Cotton and bamboo blends offer softness, while mesh panels provide better airflow during warmer weather. Machine-washable options are essential for easy maintenance.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<p><strong>When can I start using a baby carrier with my newborn?</strong></p>
<p>Most carriers can be used from birth as long as your baby weighs at least 7-8 pounds and can hold their head up briefly. Always consult your pediatrician and follow manufacturer guidelines for safe carrying practices.</p>

<p><strong>How long can I carry my newborn in a carrier?</strong></p>
<p>For newborns, limit carrying time to 1-2 hours at a stretch, taking breaks to check on your baby's breathing and comfort. As your baby grows and develops better head and neck control, you can gradually increase carrying duration.</p>

<p><strong>What's the difference between structured carriers and wraps?</strong></p>
<p>Structured carriers have buckles, straps, and predetermined shapes, making them easier to put on quickly. Wraps are long pieces of fabric that you tie around yourself, offering more customization but requiring more practice to master the technique safely.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The Ergobaby Omni 360 emerges as our top pick for its versatility, comfort, and ability to grow with your child from newborn through toddler years. For parents seeking the ultimate in newborn comfort and bonding, the Solly Baby Wrap provides unmatched closeness and customization for those precious early months.</p>
